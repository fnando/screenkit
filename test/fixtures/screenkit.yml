# The episodes directory is where the source files for each episode are stored.
# A new episode can be generated with `screenkit episode new`.
#
# The episode directory name can include placeholders:
# - %{episode_number}: The episode number
# - %{episode_slug}: A URL-friendly slug for the episode title
# - %{date}: The current timestamp in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.
#
# You can have padded episodes number by using a format string that looks like
# `%<episode_number>03d` (e.g. `001`).
episode_dir: episodes/%<episode_number>03d-%{episode_slug}

# The resources directory contains additional resource files used in the video.
# These can include images, sounds, fonts, etc.
# When defining your configuration, you can just specify the partial path. For
# instance, if you have an image at `resources/images/picture.png`, you can just
# refer to it as `images/picture.png`.
#
# You can also specify absolute paths, like system font directories.
#
# To point to the episode directory, use the placeholder `%{episode_dir}`.
