# The episodes directory is where the source files for each episode are stored.
# A new episode can be generated with `screenkit episode new`.
#
# The episode directory name can include placeholders:
# - %{episode_number}: The episode number
# - %{episode_slug}: A URL-friendly slug for the episode title
# - %{date}: The current timestamp in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

# You can have padded episodes number by using a format string that looks like
# `%<episode_number>03d` (e.g. `001`).

# The output directory is where the generated video files will be saved.
# You can change this to any directory you prefer.
